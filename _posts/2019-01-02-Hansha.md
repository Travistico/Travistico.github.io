# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:


You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

```javascript
var isSquare = function(n){
//Observations a number is a square one if the sqare root of it is an integer.
//Steps if n>=0 && the square root of it is a whole number return true, else false.
  return n<0 ? false : Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n)) ? true : false;
}
```
