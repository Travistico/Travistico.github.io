# Maximum Length Difference!   
   
   
You are given two arrays a1 and a2 of strings. Each string is composed with letters from a to z. Let x be any string in the first array and y be any string in the second array.

Find max(abs(length(x) âˆ’ length(y)))

If a1 and/or a2 are empty return -1

```javascript
function mxdiflg(a1, a2) {
//Observations we need to find the diffrence in length between the longest str in each arr
//Steps 1.return -1 if empty else 2.using map set array values to thier lengths and combine
//3. sort by length and subtract to find the diffrence.
if(a1==''||a2==''){
return -1;
}
a1= a1.map(x=>x.length), a2=a2.map(x=>x.length);

function diff(arr1,arr2){
return Math.abs(Math.max.apply(this,arr1)-Math.min.apply(this,arr2))
}

return diff(a1,a2)>diff(a2,a1)? diff(a1,a2) : diff(a2,a1);
```
